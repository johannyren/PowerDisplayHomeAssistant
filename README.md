# PowerDisplayHomeAssistant

This is a small display that shows the current electricity consumption, together with a graph of the today's electricity price, using either NordPool or Tibber. The software pulls the data from a Home Assistant instance, so all sources must be available there.

The hardware consists of a Wemos D1 Mini and a ILI9341 display. Wiring is shown in the pictures.
